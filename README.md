I'll analyze your code and generate a detailed **README.md** file based on it. Let me check the contents of your Jupyter Notebook first.

Your code is implementing a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification** (Cats vs Dogs) using **Keras and TensorFlow**. Based on your code, here’s a well-structured **README.md** file:

# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier - CNN  

This project is a **Deep Learning-based Image Classifier** that differentiates between images of **cats and dogs** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is built using **Keras and TensorFlow** and trained using **ImageDataGenerator** for data augmentation. 🚀  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Uses **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** for image classification  
✅ Includes **Convolutional (Conv2D), Pooling (MaxPool2D), Flatten, and Dense layers**  
✅ Implements **Data Augmentation** using `ImageDataGenerator`  
✅ Uses **Binary Crossentropy** loss function for classification  
✅ Trained using `model.fit_generator()`  

## 🏗️ Model Architecture  
The model consists of the following layers:  

1. **Convolutional Layer (`Conv2D`)** – Extracts features from images  
2. **Max Pooling Layer (`MaxPool2D`)** – Reduces dimensions while preserving key information  
3. **Flatten Layer (`Flatten`)** – Converts feature maps into a 1D vector  
4. **Fully Connected Layers (`Dense`)** – Processes features and classifies images  
5. **Output Layer (`Dense`)** – Uses **Sigmoid Activation** for binary classification (Cat/Dog)

## Dataset & Directory Setting
- You can dwonload the dataset from browser.
- then create two directories one for cats and one for dogs.
- then put these directories in one directory named as "train".

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

1️⃣ **Clone this repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibhav208/Cat-vs-Dog-CNN.git
cd Cat-vs-Dog-CNN
```  

2️⃣ **Install dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```  

3️⃣ **Prepare dataset:**  
- Place the dataset inside `dataset/training_set` and `dataset/test_set` directories.  
- Ensure folders `cats/` and `dogs/` exist inside these directories.  

4️⃣ **Train the model:**  
```bash
python train.py
```  

5️⃣ **Test the model:**  
```bash
python predict.py --image sample.jpg
```  

## 🎯 Training Process  
The model is compiled with:  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy  
- **Activation Functions:** ReLU, Sigmoid  
- **Batch Size:** 32  
- **Epochs:** 10  

## 📊 Results  
The model is capable of classifying **cats and dogs with high accuracy** after training.  

📷 **Example Prediction:**  
✅ **Input:** Image of a cat  
✅ **Output:** 🐱 **Cat** (Confidence: 95%)  

## 🔥 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Improve accuracy with **Data Augmentation**  
🔹 Experiment with **Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG16, etc.)**  
🔹 Deploy as a **Web App using Flask**
